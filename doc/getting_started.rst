Getting Started
===============

Welcome to the **synutility** documentation. This guide will assist you in setting up **synutility**, a versatile toolkit designed to streamline and enhance your workflows.

Introduction
------------

**synutility** is designed to provide tools and functions that simplify complex tasks and improve productivity. It is essential for professionals looking to optimize their processes efficiently.

Installation
============

Installing **synutility** is straightforward using pip, the Python package installer. For a more controlled and conflict-free environment, we recommend setting up **synutility** within a virtual environment.

Requirements
------------

Before installing **synutility**, ensure you have Python 3.11 or later installed on your machine. The use of a virtual environment is recommended to avoid conflicts with other Python packages.

Creating a Virtual Environment (Optional)
-----------------------------------------

Setting up a virtual environment for **synutility** is an optional but recommended step. It isolates the installation and dependencies of **synutility** from other Python projects, which helps prevent conflicts and maintain a clean workspace.

1. **Create a virtual environment**:

   Use the following command to create a virtual environment named `synutility_env`. This step requires the `conda` package manager, which can be installed via the Anaconda distribution.

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda create -n synutility_env python=3.11

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   Once the environment is created, activate it using:

   .. code-block:: bash

       conda activate synutility_env

Installing **synutility** via Pip
---------------------------------

After setting up and activating your virtual environment, install **synutility** using pip by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install synutility

This command will download and install the latest version of **synutility** along with its required dependencies.
