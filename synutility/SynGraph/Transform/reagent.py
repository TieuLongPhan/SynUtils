def remove_reagent_from_smiles(rsmi: str) -> str:
    """
    Removes common molecules from the reactants and products in a SMILES reaction string.

    This function identifies the molecules that appear on both sides of the reaction
    (reactants and products) and removes one occurrence of each common molecule from
    both sides.

    Parameters:
    - rsmi (str): A SMILES string representing a chemical reaction in the form:
    'reactant1.reactant2...>>product1.product2...'

    Returns:
    - str: A new SMILES string with the common molecules removed, in the form:
    'reactant1.reactant2...>>product1.product2...'

    Example:
    >>> remove_reagent_from_smiles('CC=O.CC=O.CCC=O>>CC=CO.CC=O.CC=O')
    'CCC=O>>CC=CO'
