    """
    Applies a reaction rule to a list of SMILES strings and optionally prints
    the derivation graph.

    This function first converts the SMILES strings into molecular graphs,
    deduplicates them, sorts them based on the number of vertices, and
    then applies the provided reaction rule in the GML string format.
    The resulting derivation graph (DG) is returned.

    Parameters:
    - smiles_list (List[str]): A list of SMILES strings representing the molecules
    to which the reaction rule will be applied.
    - rule (str): The reaction rule in GML string format. This rule will be applied to the
    molecules represented by the SMILES strings.
    - verbose (int, optional): The verbosity level for logging or debugging.
    Default is 0 (no verbosity).
    - print_output (bool, optional): If True, the derivation graph will be printed
    to the "out" directory. Default is False.

    Returns:
    - DG: The derivation graph (DG) after applying the reaction rule to the
    initial molecules.

    Raises:
    - Exception: If an error occurs during the process of applying the rule,
    an exception is raised.
